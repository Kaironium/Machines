# Machines
These three programs are used to calculate the ratio of two unknown masses by using a physical lever machine I designed.
MACHVAR and MACHVAR2 declare and initialize all the variables describing the physical properties of the first machine (MACHVAR), and the second machine (MACHVAR2).
MACHINE prompts for d1 and d2, and then displays the range of ratios the two unknown masses could have.

All three are written in TI-Basic, which can be run on a family of Texas Instrument calculators. The code can be viewed using TI Connect CE software: https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw
